# printf

Because putnbr and putstr aren’t enough

## Summary

This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

```

• The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
• You have to recode the libc’s printf function
• It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
• It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
• It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum field width with all conversions
• It will be compared with the real printf
• If the Mandatory part is not perfect don’t even think about bonuses • You don’t need to do all the bonuses
• Manage one or more of the following conversions: nfge
• Manage one or more of the following flags: l ll h hh
• Manage all the following flags: ’# +’ (yes, one of them is a space)

```
